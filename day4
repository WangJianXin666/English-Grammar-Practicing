给学生讲一节时态课，不超过35分钟
时态由五元素组成
分别是现在、完成、进行、过去、将来。
有了五个元素就可以组成各种各样符合逻辑的时态句子。
就像化学中的几十个元素组成的构成了宇宙间的万物。
比如
现在 he speaks quickly
完成 he has spoken
进行 he is speaking
过去he spoke
将来 he will speak

一般现在完成时：hava的现在式加动词的过去分词
一般将来时：will+动词的原型。

现在我们分别来造几个二级、三级、司机时态的组合
二级 过去将会 he spoke he will come back soon.
二级 过去已经 he spoke he has finished that

关于时态，要记住这样一个原则”逻辑“正确
比如反例
he spoke he is walking???
he spoke he walked therer?????

三级时态
he spoke he will has done it.

四级时态
过去将会已经持续
He spoke he will has working on it when you come back.


终结：
一级
现在 be
过去 did
将来 will
持续 be doing
完成 have done

二级时态
过去持续
did + be doing = was doing
将会 + 已经
will + have done = will+have+done
将会持续
will + be doing = wll doing
已经+持续
have done + be doing = have been(done+be) + doing

三级时态
过去将会已经
did + will + have + done = woulkd(did+will) have done
过去将会持续
did + will + be doing = would(did + will) be doing
过去已经持续
did + have done + be doing = had(did + have) been(done+be) + doing

四级时态
过去将来完成进行
did + will + have done + be doing 
=
would(did + will) + have been(done+be) doing.
